NAME
    RT::Extension::Memo - Add a memo widget to tickets

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds a new widget to any ticket which allows to add, edit
    and display information directly on the ticket display page.

    In many cases, resolving a ticket involves to collect and store some
    information which helps the owner of the ticket to find some solution.
    Such information includes tips and tricks, *todo* list, etc. The common
    way to handle such information in RT is to paste it into comments.

    To do so has several drawbacks. First, it mixed information which is
    relevant only to the owner of the ticket with communication between
    internal actors, that occurs through comments, for instance between the
    owner of the ticket and some of her colleagues. Second, the owner of the
    ticket has to search in the history for all comments to keep up with
    what has been done and what is left to be done, various issues that have
    arisen, etc. Third, when the owner of the ticket wants to add a new
    comment, she has to leave the display page of the ticket for the update
    form, loosing any access to the history of the comments, as well as
    various information about the ticket, such as its custom fields, dates
    or people. One solution to have the history at hand when adding a new
    comment, is to reply to the previous comment each time something has to
    be added. But the information is then copied in each reply with unneeded
    and cumbersome redundancy. Fourth, replying to the previous comment
    implies that this previous comment is folded when displaying the new
    one, with the consequence that it must be unfolded to read it and that
    its content cannot be searched until it is unfolded.

    The RT-Extension-Memo plugin provides a new widget to manage such
    information. It is displayed on the top of the history in the display
    page of the ticket, therefore gathering all information at the same
    place. It can be edited directly on this same display page, with all
    information about the ticket at hand.

    Internally, such a *Memo* is stored in a single attribute, avoiding too
    much extra storage space (as it would have been the case if it was
    stored as a custom field value where all revisions are kept up in the
    database). The counterpart of this technical implementation is that
    caution has to be made when editing the *Memo*: any previous revision is
    overwritten, so if information is deleted when editing the *Memo*, it is
    actually forever lost.

CONFIGURATION
    These options are set in etc/Memo_Config.pm and can be overridden by
    users in their preferences.

    $MemoRichText
        Should "rich text" editing be enabled for memo widget?

    $MemoHeight
        Set number of lines of the textarea for editing memo.

    $MemoRichTextHeight
        Set height (in number of pixels) of the rich text editor for editing
        memo.

RIGHTS
    The following new rights can be applied at the global level or at the
    queue level:

    SeeMemo
        Users and groups with this right are able to see the *Memo* on the
        display page of a ticket.

    ModifyMemo
        Users and groups with this right are able to add a new *Memo* and to
        edit existing *Memo* attached to a ticket.

STYLING
    The CSS properties of the Memo widget can be styled by overwriting
    defaults set in static/css/memo.cc.
